# Title: Kafka-Database Integration and Message Control System on OpenShift

##Objective:
The aim of this project is to build a comprehensive, real-time data management system with Kafka and database integration, deployed on OpenShift. This system will encompass several functionalities, such as accepting, storing, retrieving and controlling the flow of text messages through Kafka topics, and ultimately storing these messages in a database.

## Detailed Description:

### Text Input Endpoint:
We will start by creating a RESTful API endpoint designed to accept text values from users. These text values will be sent to a specific Kafka topic for further processing. All text inputs should undergo sanitization and validation before submission to the Kafka topic to ensure data integrity.

### Kafka Topic Integration:
Following the receipt of text from the endpoint, the system will save the message to a designated Kafka topic. Kafka, with its robust publish-subscribe messaging mechanism, will serve as an ideal tool for this purpose, providing high scalability and real-time data handling.

### Subscriber and Database Integration:
The next step involves the creation of a Kafka subscriber that will continuously listen to the Kafka topic. Upon the receipt of any messages, it will write them into a pre-configured database. The database should be set up to handle a potentially high volume of data while maintaining data integrity.

### Database Message Listing Endpoint:
We will create another endpoint that retrieves and lists all messages from the database. This endpoint will be responsible for fetching the stored data on-demand, allowing users to view the full history of submitted messages.

### Topic Message Listing Endpoint:
This endpoint will be built to fetch and list all messages currently held within the Kafka topic. Unlike the database message listing, this endpoint will give users real-time insight into the messages that are in the process of being handled by the Kafka system.

### Subscriber Control Endpoint:
This endpoint will provide control over the Kafka subscriber, offering the capability to stop the subscriber from reading messages from the Kafka topic. This functionality can be useful in various scenarios, such as system maintenance or troubleshooting.

### Deployment to OpenShift:
Finally, the entire system will be deployed to OpenShift. OpenShift is a containerization platform that provides automated deployment, scaling, and management of applications, which will be beneficial for managing the scalability and performance of our real-time data management system.

In summary, this project aims to construct a Kafka and database integrated system with several control and data retrieval endpoints, all deployed and managed on the OpenShift platform. This setup will offer a powerful tool for real-time data management and control.
